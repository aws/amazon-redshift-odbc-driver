This directory contains the Redshift ODBC Driver installer scripts for Windows. 
To build the installer, you will need a copy of WiX installed somewhere in your system
path. The installer has been tested with WiX version 3.0.5419
WiX may be downloaded from:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/.


A. 64 bit package:

1. Run VS 2008 64 bit command prompt
2. From this directory run:

package64 <version>

The version number will default to a value set in the Make.bat batch file if
not specified on the command line. Several files will be created, but the actually installers
are:

install\RSODBC-win64-<version>.msi - 64 bit Windows Installer package

B. Note: These installers now support upgrade capability (ie, overwrite any
existing prior installation)

To workaround the overlap text and image issue in Windows installer, use Orca to edit the MSI as follows:

1. Open the MSI using Orca.
2. Go to "Control" table, sort by Dialog column.
3. Go to row, DiskCostDlg    (in Dialog column) and Descriptions (in Control column). Change Width to 200 and Height to 30.
4. Go to row, VerifyReadyDlg (in Dialog column) and InstallTitle (in Control column). Change Width to 200 and Height to 30.
5. Go to row, VerifyReadyDlg (in Dialog column) and RemoveTitle  (in Control column). Change Width to 200 and Height to 30.
6. Go to row, VerifyReadyDlg (in Dialog column) and ChangeTitle  (in Control column). Change Width to 200 and Height to 30.
7. Go to row, VerifyReadyDlg (in Dialog column) and RepairTitle  (in Control column). Change Width to 200 and Height to 30.
8. Go to row, VerifyReadyDlg (in Dialog column) and UpdateTitle  (in Control column). Change Width to 200 and Height to 30.
